# Learn Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns: How objects are created
### 1. Singleton:
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

_**Keyword:** Single instance_

### 2. Prototype:
Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows cloning objects, even complex ones, without coupling to their specific classes.

_**Keyword:** Cloning / Copying_

### 3. Builder:
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

_**Keyword:** Step by step_

### 4. Factory:
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In simple terms, the Factory defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of using a direct constructor call (new operator).

_**Keyword:** A create method_

## Structural Patterns: How objects relate to each other
## Behavioral Patterns: How objects communicate with each other
