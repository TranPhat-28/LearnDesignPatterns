# Learn Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns: How objects are created
### 1. Singleton:
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

### 2. Prototype:
Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows cloning objects, even complex ones, without coupling to their specific classes.

## Structural Patterns: How objects relate to each other
## Behavioral Patterns: How objects communicate with each other
